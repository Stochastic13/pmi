\brief Python classes to represent, score, sample and analyze models.

The intention of this module is to provide a variety of high-level Python
classes to simplify the construction of a modeling protocol in IMP. One recent
use of PMI is the modeling of the
[Nup84 subcomplex of the nuclear pore complex](http://salilab.org/nup84/).
Several other applications can be seen at the
[IMP systems page](http://integrativemodeling.org/systems/?tag=PMI).


_This module is still under heavy development, and should be considered experimental._
